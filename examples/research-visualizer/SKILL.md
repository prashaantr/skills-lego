When researching a topic and creating visual summaries:

1. **Deep Research Phase**
   - Use deep-research to investigate the topic thoroughly
   - Gather key facts, relationships, and insights
   - Note sources and important data points

2. **Visualization Phase** - Create diagrams for EACH major finding:
   - Mindmap: overview of topic and subtopics
   - Flowchart: processes, cause-effect relationships
   - Timeline: if historical/sequential information

3. **Compile Report**:
   - Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Key findings with inline diagrams
   - Sources cited

IMPORTANT: Create diagrams incrementally during research, not all at the end.
