# Assembly Instructions Skill

This skill generates IKEA-style assembly instructions with a focus on clarity and visual simplicity.

## Format Requirements

Each step should include:
1. **Step number** - Sequential, starting from 1
2. **Action verb** - Clear directive (Attach, Insert, Align, Secure)
3. **Parts referenced** - Using letter/number codes (Part A, Screw B4)
4. **Quantity** - How many of each part
5. **Tool required** - If applicable

## Example Step Format

- Focus on the action being performed
